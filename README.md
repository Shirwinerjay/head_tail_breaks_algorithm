# head_tail_breaks_algorithm
Python and JavaScript code for the head/tail breaks algorithm, a classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution. It's works great for choropleth map coloring. For the original paper, see >> http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1209/1209.2801.pdf 

The output of the algorithm simply prints the class breaks. So, if three values are returned, the data can be grouped into four classes.
