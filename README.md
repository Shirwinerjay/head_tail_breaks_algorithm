# head_tail_breaks_algorithm
Python and JavaScript code for the head/tail breaks algorithm, a classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution. It's works great for choropleth map coloring

The output of the algorithm simply prints the class breaks. So, if three values are returned, the data can be grouped into four classes.
